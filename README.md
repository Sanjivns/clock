# Time Web App

A very simple web page that shows the **current time** and **today's date**, updating every second.

## How to use

1. Make sure all files are in the same folder: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
   - On Windows, you can double-click `index.html`, or
   - Right-click `index.html` → "Open with" → choose your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
3. You should see a digital clock with the current time and date.

The time and date use your computer's local settings.
